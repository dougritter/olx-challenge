# olx-challenge

This is a coding challenge for the job process of OLX Portugal.
For this project, were used Dagger, Rx, Data Binding and MVVM as the design pattern.
I added Realm, but I had some problems with that and Data Binding Library.

I decided for using MVVM because it fits better with data binding, as can be seen in the list of RecyclerView.


An example of code with MVP is here in my github: https://github.com/dougritter/netshoes-assignment


Another project made recently for Aptoide: https://github.com/dougritter/aptoide-challenge


A project for demonstrate features of Data Binding that I wrote for a speaking: https://github.com/dougritter/data-binding-examples
